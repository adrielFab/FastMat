# FastMat

FastMat is an android game which involves answering simple mathematical equations in a set amount of time.

The purpose of creating this projects was because of my sister of mine. Since smartphones have become so involved in the lives of many, especially for young children, I decided to create an android app where not only will she have fun, but she will also develop strong mental skills. Nonetheless, due to the added timer in the game, the brain will work at a high intensity, which will strengthen the brain's capacity to think and remember.
